        <h2> Dining </h2>
        <p1> Mrs. Kodjo 
            Her stall attracts a mixed crowd of locals. 
            As you approach the stand, you’ll spot the energetic matron rolling balls of batter with her palm and dropping them in blisteringly hot oil. 
            Crunchy on the outside, yet sweet and airy on the inside, the beignets are absolutely delicious. 
            Ouest Foire, Dakar, Senegal

            La Pointe des Almadies
            Tucked away at the far end of Les Almadies, this restaurant was a hidden gem a decade ago, but its reputation has spread all over the city. 
            While the place is popular for its seafood paella and dishes from the wood-fired grills, 
            check out the Thai beef with red curry and coconut milk, or the crab and shrimp gratin.

            Le Carré
            This atmospheric spot buzzes with a relatively young crowd, partly thanks to the stunning views. 
            The sunset calls for inventive cocktails like the sweet-and-sour Maad, 
            a crowd-pleaser made with a local favorite fruit of the same name (also known as saba Senegalensis).

            Dibiterie Le Mboté
            Le Mboté is one of Dakar’s most popular dibiteries, a place specializing in dibi, the local grilled street meat of choice. 
            This spot is relatively small, and as you step inside you are immediately welcomed by the warmth of the blazing fire in the roasting area.
            Le Mboté has minimal seating, so you may wish to pick up your dibi to go.
